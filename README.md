# Ear-Biometrics-Research-Paper
Through this project, I collected a dataset of ear images, preprocessed the data, and applied various feature extraction techniques to improve the recognition accuracy. I also implemented different machine learning models, such as SVM, KNN, and Random Forest, and evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
